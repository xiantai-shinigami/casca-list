## 📌 Overview

A curated list of **free and low cost** study resources for aspiring engineers, covering fundamental principles, online courses, and certification prep.

## Choosing a Discipline

Personally I watch a few youtubers/streamers for topics to see if what they do is what I want to do next. Since you like to work with your hands I'd stray away from comp sci, physics, math focused stuff (like data analytics or AI or Machine Learning). Those are almost all in your brain/hands off stuff.

If you like computer stuff though you could do computer engineering (chip manufacturing for instance) or robotics. Those would be things with hands on stuff that make tons now and probably will continue to do so and cant be just "taken over by AI"

### Hands on Stuff

~ *I think almost all of these will be good in the future and even though AI is a thing, you'd make decent $ and there are so many discoveries yet to be made here.*

🗺 If you don't mind doing field work (going outdoors on occasion to do your job or to a location):

- ~={orange}Mechanical Engineering (building any kind of machinery, motors, cars, robotics too but that is also some crossover with comp sci)=~
  - (note: if i had to guess this is the one you'd like^)
- Civil Engineering (building roads, dams, streets, laying out plumbing for cities)
- Environmental Engineering (waste water plants, nuclear, *i think* fire engineering is in this area too, pollution/epa stuff)
- Bioengineering (medicine, devices etc)
- Chemical Engineering
- Electrical Engineering (all the power shit, might be good with new power tech /batteries/ solar)
- Industrial Engineer (this is what my older sister is she worked at clothing manufacturing automation like levis and russell athletics). You lay out manufacturing stuff aka do you like *~={orange}Satisfactory or Factorio*=~ the game?):

**Free Online Engineering Classes**

- [Engineer4Free](https://www.engineer4free.com/) – Offers free university-level engineering courses, covering topics like calculus, structural analysis, and project management.
- [Coursera Engineering Courses](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=engineering) – Provides beginner to advanced engineering courses from top universities, including mechanical, civil, and electrical engineering. 🚩**~={green} This is my #1 recommend for classes, just never pay and sign up as "auditing" the class.=~** [^1]

~={orange}*You do not need certs or degrees right now. If that ends up being an issue and you do need them down the road you'll have more experience under your belt and can get your employer to pay, scholarships and/or pay local online stuff.*=~

**Structured Training Programs**

- [Engineering Education & Training (EET USA)](https://eetusa.com/) – Specializes in exam prep for **Fundamentals of Engineering (FE)** and **Professional Engineer (PE)** certifications, with live webinars and on-demand courses.

### 🎉Fun Stuff 🎉

On days I'm unmotivated and to keep this not boring I gamify everything.
I make studying like a mini quest list. There are even apps that do this for free like [Habitica RPG goals](https://habitica.com/) - the other 3 people in my party are other coworkers two of them are game devs one at Blizzard haha.
